# Open Source and Why It Matters
_People only code for the money, don't they?_

Many people thought that open source programmes and softwares are equal to free software. But the fact is, _they're not_.\
Let's learn what their differences are and eventually understand why Open Source Matters to the society

- What does Open-Source means?\
Open source generally means a program that has an open [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) to download and view for the general public. Open source doesn't restrict your rights in copying the source code, and modifying it. This differs a lot with closed source code, in which the code **has** to be kept **secret** to the general public.
- What is the benefit in using Open-Source Software?\
Open-Source software have many kind of advantages, for example:
    1. They're Free
    2. They're generally more secured
    3. They're supported by the community
    4. They're from the people that genuinely love the software
- Why do I need to care about Open-Source and Closed-Source?\
Well, there's a lot of examples about companies collecting your data and selling them to the highest bidder, you don't want that to happen to you, don't you? So one of the ways to actually make them not doing what they want, we can all contribute to open source, how?
