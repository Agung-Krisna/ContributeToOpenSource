# Open Source and Why It Matters
_People only code for the money, don't they?_

Many people thought that open source softwares are equal to free software. But the fact is, _they're not_.\
Let's learn what their differences are and eventually understand why Open Source Matters to the society.

- What does Open-Source means?\
Open source generally means a program that has an open [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) to download and view for the general public. Open source doesn't restrict your rights in copying the source code, and modifying it. This differs a lot with closed source softwares, in which the code **has** to be kept **secret** to the general public.

- What are the differences between Closed-Source software and Open-Source software?\
Here are some differences between Closed-Source software and Open-Source software:
    1. Open-Source softwares are free (as in freedom, not beer), while Closed-Source software are generally paid.
    2. Open-Source softwares can be personally reviewed by each and everyone of its user. This means you can decide if the software is good enough based on the code itself. You need to rely on the Company's advertising and policies if you're using a Closed-Sourced software.
    3. Open-Source softwares are often have frequent updates based on the users' issues and reports. Closed-Source softwares rely on their development team to release an update for that particular software.
    4. Open-Source softwares are driven by the people that are willing to take their time to create a software for the community. While Closed-Sourced softwares are generally driven by targets and profits.

- What are the differences between Open-Source software and _Free_ software?\
Many people made thought that free software are Open-Source, but essentially, they're two _separate_ things. Here are the key factors about why they're different:\
    1. Open-Source softwares need to have written source code that can be readable by humans (using alphanumeric characters), while Free softwares sometimes don't release their source code to the general public.
    2. Open-Source softwares need to be open to the public, what that means is that their project must be visible to the public and also they need to listen to what the public asks for their software, either it be feature updates or issue updates. Free softwares usually rely on a developer team that code the software and they sometimes release updates whenever they see fit.
    3. Open-Source softwares need to have clear documentations about what they update in their softwares. Free softwares are don't usually come with detailed documentations about their updates.
    4. Open-Source softwares don't come with annoying ads and obnoxious trackers, because they don't set their target for money and publicity. Free softwares usually have ads, trackers, and sometimes even selling your data.

- What are the benefits in using Open-Source Software?\
Open-Source software have many kind of advantages, for example:
    1. They're Free
    2. They're generally more secured
    3. They're supported by the community
    4. They're from the people that genuinely love the software
