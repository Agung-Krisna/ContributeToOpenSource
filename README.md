# Open Source and Why It Matters
_People only code for the money, don't they?_

Many people thought that open source programmes and softwares are equal to free software. But the fact is, _they're not_.\
Let's learn what their differences are and eventually understand why Open Source Matters to the society

- What does Open-Source means?\
Open source generally means a program that has an open [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) to download and view for the general public. Open source doesn't restrict your rights in copying the source code, and modifying it. This differs a lot with closed source code, in which the code **has** to be kept **secret** to the general public.
- Why do I need to care about Open-Source and Closed-Source?\
